Trade+ is a trading plugin for Spigot servers versions 1.7.10 and up. I've decided to open-source it since I don't have much time to work on it anymore.

If you feel like 'donating'/paying for it, you can do so on the SpigotMC resource page: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/23138/

But if you want to build it from this and use that, you may. I was never really in it for the money anyway, I'd rather have as many people as possible have access to it, especially since I don't have much time to work on it these days. :)

If you find bugs or want to add features, you are, of course, more than welcome to submit pull requests. Thanks!

Side Note:
If the commits look like a mess, that's because I'm still not great with git yet. :P Sorry
